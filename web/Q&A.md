## What is socket?

---
>> A socket is an abstraction through which an application may send and receive data, in much the same way as an open file allows an application to read and write data to stable storage. A socket allows an application to "plug in" to the network and communicate with other applications that are also plugged in to the same network. Information written to the socket by an application on one machine can be read by an application on a different machine, and vice versa.

A **socket** in Java is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. 
- A **socket** is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
