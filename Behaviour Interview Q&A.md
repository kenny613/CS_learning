## SWE version
thanks for having me today. I am Kenny.  I am a SWE. with over 2 years of experience of profeessional exp. in the oy industry and investment banking environment.  Personally I would descrbe myself as a passionate and collaborative

as you know Currently, I am working for Societie Générale Before this role, I also had 2 internship before I graduated with my undergraduate degree Computer Science back in 2022 in VUHK

Over the past two years, I have earned wide exposure to investment banking tech, architecture as well as financial market. I developed my expertise in FS dev as well as hands on with DevOps practices. and 

In my role, I am responsible for delivering  high quality digitalization projects for critical operation to  Compliance with the opportunity to also liaised with experts from  front to back experts. 

We do leverage on tech stack such as Python and Java with Spring for backend. Under the agile framework, Together we delivered 7-8 RegtTch applications built They served for different purpose such as 
- Trade Surveillance application, 
- Automatized web scraping for daily operation (Daily Regulatory update by web scraping)
- Critical monitoring  system
- mitigate risk (possible employees' business activates/ actions that may vioalte against the company rules/ COC)
	- Unauthorized trading with ML
	- abnormal volume of communication
	- Political exposed stakeholder
	- Declaring their travel for Sales
- L1-L3 supports
- We also initialize a Cloud transformation milestone to enhance software reliability


Besides software engineering, machine learning is also the most exciting subject for me as I took Data Science during my undergraduate study. And I was glad to work with a group of intelligent Data Scientist in one of my internship.

with that being said, I am extremely curious to see how a finical firm can generate business value by integrating ML into SWE practices. I also pretty much appreciate the beauty and satisfaction behind software engineering, how to utilize problem solving skills and modern tech to optimize and enhance the robustness of application

I think that's pretty much about myself and some of my insights. Feel free to drop my question

#### What is the biggest challenge? / the most important element?
##### Business:
1. Clarity and smooth Communication skill with business users
	- Avoid over-complicated the issue
	- Using non-technical terms (top-down approach)
		- e.g. Explaining what is web scraping, what is a "normal distriubtion"
1. Expectation management (Exceed expectation)
	- Most vital eleemnt (Besr for client)
	- Understand the system well 
	- Need to let users to know what we can do and what we cant do 
		- Dont over promise anything or over commit
		 There is a hype on A.I. these days that make A.I. looks so overpower.
			- Users make not have techical background to understand the concern behind
			- e.g. Sufficeny of Data, security bloakcage...
	- Proposing possible enhancement on top of what they asked for
	- Better estimate of the timeline and manhours of project
	- They do not need lots of fancy stuff (sth good to have) but we are encouraged to propose thiongs to exceed their expeceiotn
		- e.g. good to have feature
	- Its a task for us to balance what we can offer more given limited time and capcitiycies
##### technical
- Latency/ responsiveness is vital
- Resilience 
- what can you leverage on?

---
#### Why are you a good fit?
- Strong technical background
- financial intuition Investment banking experience for in-house application
	- Security concern
	- Agile methodology
	- Work within a team of multinational experts
	- technology tools
	- L1-L3 support experience
- Client centric attitude
- Enjoy working with experts from diff background, exchange of new ideas and solution
- Cluture fits, I love to innvoate, and I hear in the previous
---
#### What is some failure you encountered before in your professional experience
- The client asked us to build an application but never start using it, the application is being decomissed and 
- Disapontined because I was the engineer who take the most effort to develop the projects
- although They told us it was not about the quality but mainly the change of request and cost estimate
	- What if I think one more step forwaerds?
	- What if I deliver some extra, something good to have features
		- It is about not only to meet requirement but what more you can bring
		- How to increase the business impact and value of your projects by innovation
		- How to better suit their need
			- Not only fulfilling requirements and stop
		- Mope about a client centric mind set
-

#### What do you think is the most important to be good software engineer
- Never stop learning
- Hard to keep the motivation, there are lots of hurdle
- The challenges are always here, and you will suffer, but the satisfaction and insight you own after you break thorough is huge, 
---
#### What is the biggest achievement in your professional experience?
- Develop a web application from sraacthc as an intern
	- Nobody knew web application and the client want an interface
	- I was not an experts as well but I got little expeirence and i think it can be very interesting
- From nothing, keep reading docs and try and error
- The application is successully integrated with the ML components and the clients are very satitised with that
- Bring decent revenue for the startup
- My colleagues didn't expect a intern could make such imapct and I receiveed a return offer afterwards
- Takeaway>?
	- Trust is important
	- Proactive help your help but not passively
	- Dont afraid to speak up if you finds things may work better

---
#### What do you think is the most important working in team?
- Listener and respect others with open minded
- I worked in the team with memebers from more than 4 nationality, each one has different working style and speak differently
	- For example, Chinese are more focus on their own work while some team members from French and Italian are more exposed to making connection and conversation 
		- Different working style, but still they are delivering
		- Manager perceive it as the bad working attiture 
	- Discussion of different approach to handle data pathcing
		- my manager solely relly of her experience and didn't accept, stubbornes
		- But other approaches were actually feasible and not bad for a t

#### Tell me an experience where you challenge the authority
1. S&T:
	- Challenge professor about the CSCI3180 assemesment schemem, 
	- 80% of exam score
	- Too deterministic, once student ha

1. A
	- Challenge the professor and express my unsatisfactory on the grading scheme
	- Positive responses from student
	- Knew that the scheme is fixed for last few semesters as no students opposed against it

2. R:
	- Didn’t change due to near the end of semester but professor let me know that he have already taken it into account and possible change in next semester
	- Flexible scheme, either 80% or account 70% + 10% on lab asseement, the highest one

3.  Learnt:
	- Don’t strictly follow the rule,
	- Reason why things exist, be critical
	- Things exist there does not mean it is true or untouchable, like tradition
		- Key to innovation
	- thinking out of the box
	- Authority != inevitable or correct
---
#### Biggest weakness
- My greatest weaknesses is that I sometimes concentrate too much on a project's details. 
- Overly detial oreiented, too rigid to undetand all the things
	- Reading research, to concerned on understanding very concepts  
		- I just go to search for the underlying mechanism, prinbple
	- Reading books when i saw some words idk, i will need to search for translation one-by-one
- Detail oriented is curial but sometimes it will be the blocker to myself to refocus on sth more important
- Mess up my prority affects my productivity or the ability of my team to meet deadlines."
	- You dont need to know how keywords is made to use keywords
	- You dont need to understand all the maths terms to know how to apply

## Application Wise
#### Breach Log
- Regulatory Monitoring system
- Record all the employee breach records
	- e.g. breaching code of conduct
	- Unauthorized trade without approval
	- Missing declaration of travel 
- Complex Scoring system to local seriousness of the cases
- Cultivate the culture of compliance
#### SmartRobot
- Application layer to enhance underlying vendor tool for examine trades and flagging suspicious trade
- There are too many false positive record
- Built a tools on top of the API client on the vendor tool to minimize number
	- By rules
- Multithreading to read Smart  (trade data) every day
- Provide a layer of APIs 
#### Regwatch
- Automated Daily Regulatory news/feed extract from >= 300 sources website daily
- Update-to-date compliance regulatory policy update from authorizites
	- .e.g HKMA, SFC, US office of commerce, sanction authority
- Generic and reusable web scraping tools
	- Reusable for different website 
	- Allow non-technical users to configure the HTML tags from the site based on the structure of the HTML tags
	- Minimize the effort to customize different logic for different websites, cutomization
- Integration with Email (outlook) autoposcraping
	- Blocker to explore the usage of Graph API 

#### Statement Log
- internal monitoring of employees personal trading record
- Store the statement and allows compliance officer and flag trades that without approval beforehand
