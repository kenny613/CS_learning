thanks for having me today. I am Kenny.  I am a SWE. I have over 2 years of expeirence in SWE industry and investment banking environment.  I would say myself as  a passionate and collaborative

Currently, I am working for Societie Générale Before this role, I also had 2 internship before graduting beack in 2022 iwth 

During my ten-nya in SG. I have gradually exposed  to investment banking tech, architecure as well as financial market. I developed my expertise in FS dev as well as hands on with DevOps parctises. and 

In my role, I am responsible for delivering  high quality digitalization projects for critical operation to  Compliance with the opportunity to also liaised with experts from  front to back experts. 

We do leverage on tech stack such as Python and Java with Spring for backend. Under the agile framework, Together we delivered 7-8 RegtTch applications built They served for different purpose such as 
- enhance Trade Surveillance, 
- Automation for daily operation (Daily Regulatory update by web scraping)
- facilitating critical monitoring 
- mitigate risk (possible employees' business activates/ actions that may vioalte against the company rules/ COC)
	- Unauthorized trading with ML
	- abnormal volume of communication
	- Political exposed stakeholder
	- Declaring their travel for Sales
- L1-L3 supports
- We also iniatialize a Cloud transformation milestone to enhance software reliability


Besides software engineering, machine learning is also the most exciting subject for me as I took Data Science during my undergraduate study. And I was glad to work with a group of intelligent Data Scientist in one of my internship.

with that being said, I am extremely curious to see how a finical firm can generate business value by integrating ML into SWE practices. I also pretty much appreciate the beauty and satisfcation behind software engineering, how to utilize problem solving skills and modern tech to optimize and enhance the robustness of application

I think that's pretty much about myself and some of my insights. Feel free to drop my question
