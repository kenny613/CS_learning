thanks for having me today. My name is Kenny. I am Software Engineer with more than 2 years of post bahcler experience. Currently, I am  currently working for Societie Generale with exposure to investment banking techonolgotyes and rahchitecurte. I also had 2 internship experience before graduting with a Computer Sicnec degree back in 2022 . 

The Software Engineering technologies I am am most familair
- Backend:
	- Python with Flask, 
	- java with spring 
	- SQL
- 
- Frontend
	- HTML + CSS + JS
	- little expeirnce on REact and Type script

Besides software engineering, I also pushed myself to acquire heroical knowledge of ML during my undergraduate study espeically in my pervious research project. 

Therefore, besides appreciating the beauty of software engineering,  I am extremely curious and open in integrating ML with SWE as I see leveraging machine learning capabiities would be a huge advantage for financial firm to facilitate automate and predictive analysis. Thus to create enormous business value . Besides, i would love to harness and leverages any possible methodologyes or technologies to improve performance and the design

going back to my current tenure as an engineer in investment banking. I get used to corporate with front to back office experts in delivering in-house solution  to digitalize critical opertion for Compliance team within the whole APAC region. 

We leverage on tech stack such as Python and Java with Spring for backend. We also developer our own frontend interfaces HTML CSS. Under eh agile framework, Together we have 7-8 Regtech applications built by our team with only 4 members . They served for different purpose usch as 
- improving Trade Surveillance, 
- Automation for daily operation (Daily Regulatory update by web scraping)
- facilitating critical monitoring possible employees' business activates/ actions that may vioalte against the company rules/ COC
	- Unauthorized trading

- There are too many false positive record
- Built a tools on top of the API client on the vendor tool to minimize number
	- By rules
#### Regwatch
- autmoated Daily Regulatory news/feed extract from >= 300 sources website daily
- Generic and reusable web scraping tools
	- Reusable for different webssite b
	- Allow non-technical compliacnce officers to configure the HTML tags  based on the structuer of the HTML tags

#### Statement Log
- internal mointoring of employees personal trading record
- Store the statement and allows compliane officer and flag trades that without approval beforehand



## Possible Questions
#### Why flask and why Spring?
- Flask
	- Light weighted
	- Better library for data manipulation
- Spring
	- Learning curve is higher
	- More customized
	- Less light weighted
